# FlareSolverr Integration for Cloudflare Bypass

## üéâ Migration Complete!

Your scraper has been successfully migrated from PuppeteerSharp to **FlareSolverr + HttpClient** for much better Cloudflare bypass capabilities.

## What Changed?

### ‚úÖ Removed
- **PuppeteerSharp** - No more browser automation complexity
- Complex stealth configurations and browser management
- Memory-heavy browser instances

### ‚úÖ Added
- **FlareSolverr Client** - Dedicated Cloudflare bypass service
- HTTP-only requests - Much faster and more reliable
- Better session management and error handling

## How It Works

1. **FlareSolverr** runs as a Docker container that handles Cloudflare challenges
2. Your scraper sends requests to FlareSolverr instead of directly to websites
3. FlareSolverr uses a real browser internally to solve challenges and returns clean HTML
4. Your scraper processes the HTML using HtmlAgilityPack as before

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start FlareSolverr (Required)

Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup_flaresolverr.sh
```

Or manually start FlareSolverr:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=flaresolverr \
  -p 8191:8191 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest
```

### 2. Run Your Scraper

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Key Benefits

### üöÄ **Performance**
- **Faster**: No browser overhead per request
- **Less Memory**: HTTP-only requests vs full browser instances
- **More Stable**: Dedicated service handles browser complexities

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**
- **Better Cloudflare Bypass**: FlareSolverr is specifically designed for this
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains sessions across requests
- **Auto-Recovery**: Handles session expiration automatically

### üîß **Maintenance**
- **Simpler Code**: Removed complex browser automation
- **Easier Debugging**: HTTP requests are easier to trace
- **Better Error Handling**: Clearer error messages and recovery

## Code Changes Summary

### VideoScraper Class
```csharp
// OLD: Complex PuppeteerSharp setup
private IBrowser _browser;
await _browser.NewPageAsync();
await page.GoToAsync(url);

// NEW: Simple HTTP requests via FlareSolverr
private readonly FlareSolverrClient _flareSolverr;
string html = await _flareSolverr.GetPageContentAsync(url);
```

### Key Methods Updated
- `Initialize()` - Now just tests FlareSolverr connection
- `ScrapeChannel()` - Uses HTTP requests instead of browser navigation
- `GetVideoSourceUrl()` - Parses HTML directly instead of request interception
- `MonitorChannel()` - Simplified without browser management

## FlareSolverr Management

### Check Status
```bash
docker ps | grep flaresolverr
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker logs flaresolverr
```

### Restart if Needed
```bash
docker restart flaresolverr
```

### Stop FlareSolverr
```bash
docker stop flaresolverr
```

## Troubleshooting

### FlareSolverr Connection Issues
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Check if FlareSolverr container is running: `docker ps`
3. Test FlareSolverr: `curl http://localhost:8191`
4. Check logs: `docker logs flaresolverr`

### If Scraping Fails
1. FlareSolverr might be handling a complex challenge - wait a moment
2. Check FlareSolverr logs for errors
3. Restart FlareSolverr if needed: `docker restart flaresolverr`

## Performance Tips

1. **Keep FlareSolverr Running**: Don't stop/start it frequently
2. **Rate Limiting**: The scraper includes delays between requests
3. **Session Reuse**: FlareSolverr maintains sessions automatically
4. **Monitor Resources**: FlareSolverr uses less resources than your previous setup

## Next Steps

Your scraper is now much more robust and should handle Cloudflare protection reliably. The setup script will ensure FlareSolverr is running whenever you need to scrape.

**Happy scraping! üéØ**
